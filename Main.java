// 1. Create a Student class to simulate a student's profile. The class should have the following attributes: student ID, name, and GPA. 
// Include methods to updateGPA() and printProfile(). Implement functionality to create new student profiles, update GPAs, and print student profiles.

// 2. Create a BankAccount class to simulate a bank account. The class should have the following attributes: account number, account holder name, and balance.
// Include methods to deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance().
// Implement functionality to
// - Create new accounts
// -Deposit money into the account
// - Withdraw money
// - Check the account balance.

// 3. Create a Shopping Cart class to simulate an online shopping cart. The class should have the following attributes: cart ID, customer name, and items (a list of products). 
// Include methods to addItem(), removeltem(), and calculate Total(). Implement functionality to create new shopping carts, add/remove items, and 
// calculate the total cost of items in the cart.



// 4. Question Design and implement a Java program that simulates a financial transaction system. Your system should be capable of processing different types of transactions, 
//such as deposits and withdrawals, and alerting if any transactions exceed certain limits. Use interfaces to define common behaviors for transactions and implement 
//these behaviors in different transaction classes.
// Create an interface named Transaction with at least two methods:
// getAmount() which returns the amount of the transaction as a double
// isValid() which returns a boolean indicating if the transaction is valid based on certain criteria.
// Implement the Transaction interface in at least three separate classes,
// DepositTransaction and Withdrawal Transaction. Each class should have a constructor that sets a limit for transactions and specific logic to determine if the transaction is valid.

// 5. Design and implement a Java program that simulates a network monitoring system. Your system should be capable of monitoring different types of network devices, 
//such as routers and switches, and alerting if any devices are experiencing errors or downtime. Use interfaces to define common behaviors for network devices and 
//implement these behaviors in different device classes.
// Create an interface named Network Device with at least two methods:
// getStatus() which returns a String indicating the current status of the device isAvailable() which returns a boolean indicating if the device is currently available and 
//functioning correctly. Implement the Network Device interface in at least three separate classes, Router and Switch. 
//Each class should have a constructor that sets specific properties for the device and specific logic to determine its status and availability.

// 6. Design and implement a Java program that simulates the undo feature of a text editor using a stack. 
//The program should support adding text to the editor and undoing changes. The stack should store strings, each representing a version of the text. Implement methods for:
// adding text to the editor: addText(String text)
// undoing changes : undo()
// -
// getting the current text: getCurrentText()

// 7. Design and implement a simple Java application that prompts the user to enter a string within a specified length, for example, between 5 and 20 characters. 
//Your application should throw and handle a custom exception if the user enters a string outside this length.
// InvalidStringLengthException:
// A custom exception that is thrown when the user enters a string with a length outside the valid range (5 to 20 characters).

// 8. Design and implement a simple Java application that prompts the user to enter a valid email address. Your application should throw and handle a custom exception 
//if the user enters an invalid email address.
// InvalidEmailException:
// A custom exception that is thrown when the user enters an email address that does not match a valid email pattern (e.g., it should contain '@' and '.' characters).

// 9. Write a program that prompts the user to enter five integer values and reads them into an array. The program should consist of the following methods:
// a method named "max" that reads an array of integer values and returns the maximum value
// a method named "indexOfHighest" that returns the index of the highest element in an array of integers. If more than one such element exists, return the smallest index. 
//Invoke the above methods and demonstrate them in the program.

// 10. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and reads it into a string. The program should consist of the following methods:
// a method named "countVowels" that reads a string and returns the number of vowels in the string
// a method named "countConsonants" that reads a string and returns the number of consonants in the string.
// Invoke the above methods and demonstrate them in the program.
